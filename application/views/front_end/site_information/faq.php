We allocate the courier we believe will deliver your order to you in the shortest time depending on the size and weight of your order. If you are ordering for delivery outside of the Singapore, we suggest you have goods delivered to a work address rather than a home address, as our couriers only deliver between 9am and 5pm, and may require a signature on receipt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a id="f6" name="f6"></a>WILL I BE CHARGED CUSTOMS AND IMPORT CHARGES?</p><p>Any customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country. These charges must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. As customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country, we have no control over these charges, and cannot tell you what the cost would be. We recommend that you contact your local customs office for current charges before you order to avoid being charged unexpectedly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a id="f7" name="f7"></a>DO YOU DELIVER TO WORK ADDRESSES?</p><p>If you want your delivery to reach you at work, you need to be confident that someone will be there to take receipt of the goods as the courier will deliver to the place not the person. We can deliver to your permanent residential address or your place of employment as you wish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a id="f8" name="f8"></a>RETURNS OUR RETURNS POLICY</p><p>You can return any item within 7 days upon receipt for an exchange of that item if the item is faulty.
